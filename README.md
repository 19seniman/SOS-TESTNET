## DESCRIPTION 

XOS is a high-performance layer-2 solution built on the **Solana** blockchain. Its goal is to improve the scalability, speed, and cost efficiency of the Solana ecosystem, especially for applications like **GameFi, DeFi, and Web3**.

Like many other crypto projects, XOS has its own **testnet**. A testnet is a trial network where developers and users can test features and applications without using real assets. This allows them to experiment, test smart contracts, and provide feedback before the project is launched on the **mainnet** (the primary network).
